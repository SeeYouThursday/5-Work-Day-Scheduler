# 5-Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

The user is presented with the current date and hours between 9am-5pm alongside textareas to enter in tasks to be completed at a given time. Through this challenge, I have learned how utilize the JQuery and Dayjs to leverage localStorage for persistant data, while providing the user with a dynamic site.

## Usage

Visit this URL to access this application: <https://seeyouthursday.github.io/5-Work-Day-Scheduler/>

To utilize this daily planner, simply click in any of the textboxes beside a desired time and type in an event. The user will need to click the "Save" button to commit the user input to localStorage, allowing this input to be accessed whenever the user visits the site.
